A prototype email app

![A-Mail Preview](A-MAIL-Preview-480px.gif)

## Info
I use (and have tried) a lot of email apps (both on iPhone and android), and I never find the right one. I never liked the UI nor the way I interact with them. So I decided to challenge myself and try to design & code a prototype. The point was not to create a "real app" but to experiment and let my inspirations flow.

Please note, this is only a prototype and only a few interactions are working.
